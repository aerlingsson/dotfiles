One-liner:
```bash
echo "\nAdding .cfg to .gitignore..." &&
echo ".cfg" >> .gitignore &&
echo "\nCloning repo..." &&
git clone --bare git@github.com:aerlingsson/dotfiles.git $HOME/.cfg &&
echo "\nSetting config alias..." &&
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME' &&
echo "Removing .bashrc and .gitignore"
rm .bashrc .gitignore
echo "\nDoing config checkout..." &&
bash &&
config checkout
```

## Install your dotfiles onto a new system (or migrate to this setup)
This guide is ripped directly from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles, because I'm scared it might disappear one dayðŸ™ƒ
* Prior to the installation make sure you have committed the alias to your .bashrc or .zsh:
```bash
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
```

* And that your source repository ignores the folder where you'll clone it, so that you don't create weird recursion problems:
```bash
echo ".cfg" >> .gitignore
```

* Now clone your dotfiles into a bare repository in a "dot" folder of your `$HOME`:
```bash
git clone --bare <git-repo-url> $HOME/.cfg
```

* Define the alias in the current shell scope:
```bash
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
```

* Checkout the actual content from the bare repository to your `$HOME`:
```bash
config checkout
```

* The step above might fail with a message like:
```bash
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
    .bashrc
    .gitignore
Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.
Aborting
```
This is because your $HOME folder might already have some stock configuration files which would be overwritten by Git. The solution is simple: back up the files if you care about them, remove them if you don't care. I provide you with a possible rough shortcut to move all the offending files automatically to a backup folder:
```bash
mkdir -p .config-backup && \
config checkout 2>&1 | egrep "\s+\." | awk {'print $1'} | \
xargs -I{} mv {} .config-backup/{}
```

* Re-run the check out if you had problems:
```bash
config checkout
```

* Set the flag showUntrackedFiles to no on this specific (local) repository:
```bash
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```
